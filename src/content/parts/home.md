Howdy. I'm Amberley. I have long harbored the notion of doing a daily TIL diary like this. Partly for the visualization of growing and learning snowballing over time.

This site was created using the [`gatsby-starter-kit`](https://github.com/greglobinski/gatsby-starter-kit) by the talented [@greglobinski](https://twitter.com/greglobinski). He built [til.greglobinski.com](https://til.greglobinski.com/), inspired by [@swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx).

I similarly plan to use this as a repository for interesting things I learn on a daily basis, hopefully to help me remember things better (or at least to make some of my knowledge-base searchable). So, this is for me, but I hope if you've found it, that you find something helpful.

I currently work on [@gatsbyjs](https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs). Find me on Twitter at [@amberleyjohanna](https://twitter.com/amberleyjohanna).
